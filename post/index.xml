      <description>Hi!
Welcome to Tyler’s Website, and more specifically, Tyler’s blog within the website.
Since we have a lot of creative freedom with this post specifically, I thought I’d briefly talk about some of my interests!
First, as the front page of the website indicates, I am VERY passionate about the interplay between biology and nutrition. Naturally, this has led me to pursue a career in Public Health. The SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic (2020-TBD) has also fueled my passion for public health; it killed me standing by watching underprivileged communities suffer to make it through the pandemic.</description>
